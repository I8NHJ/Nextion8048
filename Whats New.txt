VK4GHZ Nextion for K3NG Rotator Controller

V2022-05-03

Fix: 
• 7.0" About page - Incorrect model number 'K050' fixed.
    Should have been 'K070'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-10-23

New: 3.2" 3.5" 5.0" 7.0" Start up behaviour.
     K3NG code v2021.10.19.04 or later REQUIRED.

     Nextion will now wait for gSC data to arrive from Arduino before
     moving onto designated start screen.

     If gSC has not been received within 5 seconds "nexSerial FAIL" 
     message appears to prompt investigation, but is still listening for gSC.

     In rotator_features.h file, comment out these two lines (default)
     //#define OPTION_DEPRECATED_NEXTION_INIT_CODE_1
     // #define OPTION_DEPRECATED_NEXTION_INIT_CODE_2

     If sending gSC needs to be delayed at Arduino, in rotator_settings.h,
     increase value from default 0.
     #define NEXTION_GSC_STARTUP_DELAY 0


Fix: 
• 5.0" 7.0" ABCKeyboard page - '7' button not working if coming from Large Az 
     page after pressing Go To button.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-07-03

Fix:
• 5.0", 7.0" Presets page - Return button not working when coming from BizgAz page.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-06-29

Note:
* This update will reset your existing Nextion settings stored in EEPROM
  Make a note of any preset Az & name tags, UDF name tags, and config settings
  before updating.


New:
• 3.2", 3.5", 5.0", 7.0" - BigAz page.
  Large Azimuth only gauge for terrestrial (non elevation/tracking) work.  
  Touch middle of gauge for keypad entry.
  Various buttons, icons and features depending on screen size.
  3.2" has touch points every 30°
  3.5" has touch points every 30°, two alternate gauge backgrounds.
  5.0" has touch points every 15°, two alternate gauge backgrounds.
  7.0" has touch points every 15°, two alternate gauge backgrounds.

  Long touch middle of Az gauge to change to alternate gauge. 
  Preselect alternate 1 / 2 gauge background on config page.

• 3.5", 5.0" 7.0" Config1 page - New button to select BiG Az gauge as default
  start up screen.


Fix:
• 3.5", 5.0", 7.0" Clock page - font preview incorrect when changing colours.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-05-21

Note:
* This update will reset your existing Nextion settings stored in EEPROM
  Make a note of any preset Az & name tags, UDF name tags, and config settings
  before updating.


New:
• 3.2", 3.5", 5.0" Clock page - Large clock & Grid Square, dark theme.
  Colours and fonts settable on 3.5" and 5.0: variants.
  Edit .hmi in Nextion Editor to change colour & fonts for 3.2" variant.

• 3.5", 5.0" Big Gauges page - Provision for 2 alternate Azimuth gauge
  backgrounds. Long touch middle of Az gauge to change to alternate gauge.

• 3.5", 5.0" Config1 page - New toggle button 'Alt Az Gauge' to pre-select 
  which alternate big gauge is displayed.

• Version for 7.0" NX8048K070. 7.0" screen has same resolution (800 x 480 px)
  as the 5.0", therefore uses the same assets from the 5.0" project.


Fix:
• 5.0" Big Gauges page - there was no direct method to reset the screen saver, 
  except for returning to normal gauges page, and then back to big gauges page.
  Pressing top left or top right of gauges or in between gauges will reset 
  screen saver timer.

• 3.5 Big Gauges page - there was no method to reset the screen saver, 
  except for returning to normal gauges page, and then back to big gauges page.
  Pressing along the top of Az/El row will reset screen saver timer.

• 3.5" Big gauges page - Timer event code in tmrSS was missing, therefore 
  screen saver timer never worked. Fixed.

• 3.5" Contest page - Timer event code in tmrSS was missing, therefore 
  screen saver timer never worked. Fixed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-05-09

Note:
* This update will reset your existing Nextion settings stored in EEPROM
  Make a note of any preset Az & name tags, UDF name tags, and config settings.


Fix:
• Assigning name to UDF4 name tag affected Preset name tag foreground colour
  due to overlapping EEPROM addresses.

• Satellite page - Park button was visible if Park feature was not enabled.
  (Thanks Andrej S56VLV)


Change:
• Program.s - All EEPROM register addresses now properly defined here.
  12 bytes allocated to azimuth & elevation presets, and name tags.
  Refer to EEPROM Table pdf.

• Name tag length increased from 6 to 8 characters. 
  YMMV with wide characters 'W' 'M' etc where screen real estate is limited.

• 5.0" MainGauges pages - Bigger Expand button to access Big Gauges page

• Diagnostics page - now responsive to features that are enabled.
  ie; Buttons hiddens if not relevant to Arduino feature settings.

• Converter page - results window wider and smaller font to fit in result string.

• 3.2" Bolder fonts on configuration pages to improve readability 


New:
• Contest page - features 8 preset buttons.
  Presets are Azimuth only.  ie; Elevation forced to zero.

• Keypad page - short touch of CLR button will backspace.
  Long touch will clear entry (as it should have been).

• Introduction of 3.2" version!
  This is a basic 'no frills' version squeezed into the limited 400 x 240 px
  screen that will suit an operator who wants a simple K3NG interface, but
  with much more functionality than what an LCD & switches can offer.

  There is no internal Moon/Sun/Sat tracking functionality, no help screens,
  no Rotor calibration page, and no set colours page, no ABC keyboard (and
  therefore no functionality associated with entering in alpha characters) 
  ie; no Go To grid square, no Preset name tags, no UDF page. 
  Colours can be changed by editing the .hmi file with the Nextion Editor..


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-04-06-01-01

Change:
• Splash page - timer 'tmrReadySC' (that waits xxx mS before expecting to see
  global system capabilities data from MCU) timing has been increased/relaxed.
  5.0" 250 mS to 500 mS 
  3.5" 250 mS to 450 mS
  To accommodate MCUs that are slow to send out gSC data resulting in the
  Nextion defaulting incorrectly to basic Az only 'cheeseburger' mode.


New:
• Config1 page - Audible Alert on/off button 
  Config1 page - Audible Alert automatically enable on power up button
  Config1 page - Audible Alert automatically disable when tracking button

• Rotor Calibration page - Sensor Plot (waveforms) button
  
• Waveforms page - graphs Az & El data vs time
  Experimental, but could be useful to visualise faulty sensor data

• Features page - Audible Alert status

• Main page - Audible Alert status icon

• MainGauges page - Audible Alert status icon

• MoonSun page - Audible Alert status icon

• Sat page - Audible Alert status icon

• TrackSet1 page - Tracking Check Intervals 

• TrackSet2 page - Tracking Rotation Intervals

• TrackSet3 page - Degree Differential Thresholds

• Diagnostics page - gV2 variable added


New/Change:
• Program.s - Global Button Status variables renamed to begin as gBSxxxxxx


Change:
• Multiple pages - Opacity of dulled icon versions of Moon, Sun, Sat, AA, AP
  changed from 35% to 20% to make inactive state more pronounced

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-03-27-01

Fix: (Thanks to VK1JA for finding)
• MainGauges page - Preset 4 button took you incorrectly to preset 3 azimuith

• MoonSun page - Preset 4 button took you incorrectly to preset 3 azimuith



V2021-03-25-01

Fix:
• Help Basic Cheeseburger page - corrected spelling of "cheeseburger"!!!  

• MainGauges page - returning from Long touch of Go To button returned
  incorrectly to Numerals (Main) page.  (Thanks to VK1JA for finding)

• MoonSun page - returning from Short touch of Go To button returned
  incorrectly to Numerals (Main) page.

• MoonSun page - returning from Long touch of Go To button returned 
  incorrectly to Numerals (Main) page.


• Sat page - returning from Short touch of Go To button returned incorrectly
  to Numerals (Main) page.

• Sat page - returning from Long touch of Go To button returned incorrectly
  to Numerals (Main) page.

• Sat page - returning from Long touch of Park button returned incorrectly
  to MoonSun page.




V2021-03-23-01

New:
• BigGauges page featuring larger Az/El gauges.
  Intended for manual (non tracking) operation ie; similar to using a real
  Yaesu G-5500 controller.
  Gauges made as large as possible, so there aint no room for tracking status
  icons etc!

• BigGauges page (5.0") - touch entry points every 15° points around Azimuth
  and Elevation gauges.

• MainGauges page - can set Presets Tag colours.
  (Could only do this on Main numerals page only)

• MainGauges page - can set Azimuth Pointer colour.  Requires long touch,
  center of gauge. (Could only do this on Main numerals page only)

• MainGauges page - can set Elevation Pointer colour.  Requires long touch,
  center of gauge. (Could only do this on Main numerals page only)

• MainGauges page - can set Azimuth colour. Touch "Az:".

• MainGauges page - can set Elevation colour. Touch "El:".

• MainGauges page - can set Preset Tag colours. Touch any preset tag.

• Config - Screen page - BigGauges page selection button as start screen
  choice.

• Config - Screen page - Tracking Settings page button added.

• Config - Screen page - Keypad Keep Value button added.
  This allows you to keep a value when going to the Numeric or ABC keypads.
  Handy as a reminder what the value that you are changing was, but requires
  use of the backspace button.  Switching off goes to keypad with blank value.

• TrackSettings page - allows entry of Moon, Sun, Satellite Check Intervals.
  (Partial support for new feature introduced by Goody 2021-03-20).
  At present, Arduino code doesn't send values to Nextion with \( command.
  No big deal... you can send new check interval times to the MCU though.

• About page - HELP Basic Cheeseburger button added + help screen explaining
  why you are not seeing what you might expect to see.


Fix:
• MainGauges page (5.0") - returning from Long touch of Presets button returned
  incorrectly to Numerals page.

• Moon/Sun Tracking page (5.0") - returning from Long touch of Presets button
  returned incorrectly to Numerals page.


Change:
• MainGauges page - Azimuth & Elevation minor calibration marks every 5/10°,
  being more human friendly to read.
  Was previously every 6° coz a clock face was used as the original template.
  Think about it!

• Configuration - Screen page
  Radio selection buttons replaced by buttons with built-in LED indicators!
  Tracking Screen page button added.
  Start screen BigGauges button added
  Update Rate maximum extended to 1500mS (was 1000mS)

• Config2 page renamed to RotorCal

• RotorCal page - behaviour of Full CW Full CCW Full Up Full Down buttons
  changed so that highlight disappears after Long touch of SET button has
  completed.

• RotorCal page - radio toggle selectors replaced with new style buttons.

• Set Colors page - Font selector radio toggle replaced with new style button.

• (Background) gBS...   old Global Button Status variables renamed for
  consistency with new gBS variables. These variables keep track of button
  states.

• (Background) Endless cosmetic pixel tweaking to help pretty things up. (?)

V2021-02-11-01

New: (Suggestion courtesy VK1JA)
Elevation Gauge hotspots.
El can be quickly sent to 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150° & 180° by touching the red markers.
Manually Data Entry still available by touching middle of gauge dial.

Azimuth Gauge hotspots.
Az can be quickly sent to 0°, 30°, 60°... 300° & 330° by touching the red markers.
Manually Data Entry still available by touching middle of gauge dial.


Fix: (Thanks VK1JA for report)
Dim to percentage diagnostic was always visible on satellite tracking page, irrespective of Diagnostics radio button.


Change:
Main Numerals Page - setting Preset Tag colour/font.
Set page now automatically appears as soon as the Tag is touched, which is now consistent with a long touch of the Nav buttons (Clock & Grid).
Previously went to set page upon release of Tag.   


Change:
Main Numerals Page - setting Large Azimuth colour/font.
Set page now automatically appears as soon as "Az" is touched, which is now consistent with a long touch of the Nav buttons (Clock & Grid).
Previously went to set page upon release of "Az".   


Change:
Main Numerals Page - setting Small Azimuth colour/font.
Set page now automatically appears as soon as "Az" is touched, which is now consistent with a long touch of the Nav buttons (Clock & Grid).
Previously went to set page upon release of "Az".   


Change:
Main Numerals Page - setting Elevation colour/font.
Set page now automatically appears as soon as "El" is touched, which is now consistent with a long touch of the Nav buttons (Clock & Grid).
Previously went to set page upon release of "El".   


Change:
UDF Help page explanation enhanced with "UDF functionality requires MCU side code customisation."
(At the risk of pointing out the obvious!)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-01-07-01

New:
Screen Saver Dim To percentage value is user definable on Config page.
Was previously hard-coded to 5%.
Can now be set 0 - 50%.

Fix:
Wrong default font for navigation buttons (Clock & Grid) being set for virgin
EEPROM.  Was font 4, should have been font 5

Fix:
Reference to (previously removed) Toggle Center button removed from Caution 
Calibration help screen.

Fix:
Screens Saver count up value & screen saver value sides swapped on MoonSat &
Sat pages  as it should have been!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-01-06-01

New:
Rotator Protocol added to Features page
GPS 'Wait' added if GPS enabled but waiting for fix on Features Page

Fix:
Toggle center button removed - Arduino code doesn't appear to process Yaesu
commands from Nextion.   Never make assumptions!
[Thanks Robert G0MYX for discovering this]
It also screwed up calibration(?)
(Suggestion: create your own User Defined Function and execute it that way)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


V2021-01-01-01
First release of 5.0" version.

New:
Has all features and functionality of 3.5" v2020-12-18-01 version plus:
Larger fonts and buttons all over
4th Preset added 
All four Presets appear on main operational pages
Preset tags colour & font can now be changed
New enhanced icons for clock type
